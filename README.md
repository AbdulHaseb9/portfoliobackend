Portfolio Backend with Express.js

Our portfolio backend is a powerful API built using Express.js and Node.js, with MongoDB and Mongoose for database interactions and Cors for cross-origin resource sharing. This backend serves as the foundation for managing and showcasing portfolios for individual users. Let's delve into its key components and functionalities:

1. Express.js and Node.js:

      Express.js provides a robust framework for building APIs and web applications in Node.js.

      Node.js enables server-side JavaScript execution, allowing for efficient and scalable backend development.

2. MongoDB with Mongoose:

      MongoDB serves as our database solution, offering flexibility and scalability for storing portfolio-related data.

      Mongoose, an ODM (Object-Document Mapper) for MongoDB, helps us define schemas, model data, and perform CRUD operations seamlessly.

3. Cors (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):

      Cors middleware is integrated to handle cross-origin requests, enabling our frontend to securely communicate with the backend from different domains.
